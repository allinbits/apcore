	// ActivityPub framework. It is a convenience layer on top of
	// go-fed/activity, which has the opposite philosophy: assume as little
	// as possible, provide more powerful but time-consuming interfaces to
	// satisfy.

	//
	// Depending on the command line flags chosen, an action can occur:
	// - Configuring the application and generating a config file
	// - Initializing a database
	// - Initializing an admin account in the database
	// - Launching the example App to serve live web & ActivityPub traffic
	//
	// All of these capabilities are supported by the framework out of the
	// box. Refer to the command line help for more details.
