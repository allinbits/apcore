// There are two competing standards: NodeInfo and NodeInfo2. Confusingly,
// NodeInfo is at version 2, so it is NodeInfo 2 vs NodeInfo2.
//
// I have no idea about the background of either. But it is late, and I find
// myself tired and, having thought this would be a quick serialize-to-JSON
// implementation, massively disappointed at what I've found instead.
//
// So, support both, I guess. Thank God, I was worried I would one day find
// myself upon my deathbed and staring into the eyes of my loved ones and
// quietly whisper in the soft exhale of my last breath "if only I could have
// implemented another NodeInfo standard, I would have had a fulfilling life".
// So my survivors would all turn to each other teary-eyed and put on my
// gravestone "NodeInfoâ€‰2" with an ambiguously-sized space in-between.
//
// If at least this means one other person doesn't have to deal with this
// dual headache, then I guess it was indeed worth it.
//
// I guess this is what happens when people can't get along and at least one
// person is being uncompromising. A lesson for me to avoid this at all costs.
